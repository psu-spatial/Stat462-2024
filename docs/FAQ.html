<details><summary><span style="color: #1388aa;">Click here for the answer</span>
</summary><p>You are encouraged to talk with each other during these labs e.g. you can see each others screens and work out answers together.</p>
<p><strong>BUT NEVER SHARE CODE OR SEND SCRIPT TO SOMEONE ELSE. ALL TEXT SHOULD BE IN YOUR OWN WORDS.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working out together the right way to apply the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/seq.html">seq()</a></code> function, then each independently adding it to your own scripts is fine.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Copy/pasting your friend’s code/text is never OK</strong>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So DISCUSS with friends, but then turn away to your own screen and write your own code and text. I will be randomly running lab reports through plagiarism software.</p>

<h2>How can I use chatGPT safely?<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#FAQ-6"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<details><summary><span style="color: #1388aa;">Click here for the answer</span>
</summary><p><br></p>
<p><span style="color: red;"><strong>This advice is specific to this class.</strong></span></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>I’m OK with you using ChatGPT, I use it! Here’s how to use it without breaking any rules.</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Imagine an older brother/sister/sibling who is always <em>super</em> confident about their answers but isn’t always right. Or if that doesn’t work for you, imagine an older friend /undergrad-LA/ friend-who-took-the-course-last-year, or someone on TV.</p>
<p><u>Picture them in your mind. I’m going to use my imaginary sister, Sam.</u></p>
<p>What do I mean?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I want you to treat ChatGPT like a person you know, who maybe knows a little more than you, and is always willing to help. They are SUPER CONFIDENT about the answers they give and definitely willing to talk like a pirate and explain anything to you ‘as though you were 7’.</p></li>
<li><p>But! You know that often ChatGPT won’t be quite right, their knowledge might be out of date and they might know a different way of getting to the answer than the one you need.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you’re thinking through any scenario or question you have, replace “ChatGPT” with your friend’s name and see what you would do in that situation. Here are some scenarios. Scroll to the end to see some example conversations you could try.</p>
<p><br></p>
<div id="what-would-sam-do" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>
<u><strong>What would Sam do?</strong></u><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#what-would-sam-do"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism/cheating..</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Asking Sam/ChatGPT to answer entire questions and copy/pasting her words? <br><u>Definitely cheating.</u></p></li>
<li><p>Getting Sam/ChatGPT to check my grammar and tweak the odd sentence? <br><u>Fine!</u></p></li>
<li><p>Going backwards and forwards with Sam/ChatGPT to work out how to phrase a paragraph, but I write the final thing? <br><u>Fine!</u></p></li>
<li><p>Using a conversation with Sam/ChatGPT as a starting point, then googling the actual sources/answers <br><u>Fine! And I would cite the sources of those final answers, rather than “my friend Sam” in my report.</u></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Citations:</strong> My professor wouldn’t be pleased if I stated a new fact and then told them “my sister Sam told me” when asked for the source, but Sam <em>might</em> help me know where to start googling so I can find the fact and its source myself.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Authorship</strong>…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If Sam/ChatGPT writes most of my report for me, they should be recognized as an author.</p></li>
<li><p>If Sam/ChatGPT helps you tweak a few sentences or brainstorm an email reply, you’re probably OK and maybe add a thank you to them at the end.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Coding</strong>…</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sam/ChatGPT is quite a good coder. I often show them/copy across my errors and see what they think.</p></li>
<li><p>But! Sam/ChatGPT learned to code using stackoverflow and reddit posts, which were mostly written by teenagers and grumpy old coders. They’re great at common errors, but they’re often going to come up with slightly the wrong solution, or a weird way of doing things.</p></li>
<li><p>So although Sam/ChatGPT will always give you an answer, it probably won’t be the most elegant one, it probably won’t be similar to how you have been taught - and like early google translate, it’s pretty easy for an expert to see that it’s not your efforts.</p></li>
<li><p>So always test and try to use use them to fix your code rather than just write it for you. It is very easy (currently) for professors to see ChatGPT generated code. It’s like your handwriting changes. But it’s great at debugging your errors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>What else is Sam/ChatGPT good &amp; bad at?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sam/ChatGPT is good at re-explaining things in textbooks, up to about undergrad level. Or ideas which have been around for a long time.</p></li>
<li><p>Sam/ChatGPT is pretty bad at newer ideas, cutting edge stuff, or interpreting textbook ideas for your own case study</p></li>
<li><p>It also does better if you are more specific e.g. can you explain this topic to me using this theorem or R package helps it know where you want it to start (maybe Sam doesn’t actually know the answer but is secretly googling so they don’t have to appear stupid in front of you)</p></li>
<li><p>But the main reason I love chatGPT is that, like with an older friend, you can ask it stupid questions and it will always help. You don’t have to worry about spelling errors writing formally. You can have an actual conversation. For example, I tend to treat it like a less clever <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D156TfHpE1Q" title="'Jarvis' from Iron Man">‘Jarvis’ from Iron Man</a> :)</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Making things up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>ChatGPT is programmed to find the series of words that sounds most like your request, it has no idea if the words are ‘true’!</strong> So Sam/ChatGPT will NEVER say they don’t know the answer. Think of the amount of times an overconfident friend/sibling says they definitely know the answer and it turns out to be wrong and they won’t even admit it!</p></li>
<li>
<p><u>Never fully trust what ChatGPT/Sam says! Always google it.</u></p>
<ul>
<li><em>For example, ChatGPT told me that Dr Helen Greatrex was someone who studied the climate impacts of disease in Oxford University and gave me a load of awards. It was so convincing I had to check I didn’t have a name-twin!</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>

<div id="example-conversation" class="section level3 unnumbered">
<h3>
<u><strong>Example conversation</strong></u><a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#example-conversation"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h3>
<p>Imagine you wanted to know if learning ANOVA or Regression is best for your career, but you don’t even really know what they are.</p>
<p>Try asking ChatGPT this series of questions :)</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>Hello! If you have achieved sentience, I hope you are well</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>What's the difference between ANOVA and regression?</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>I don't get it, can you explain it more simply?</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>I still don't get it. Especially this sentence [</code><em>copy paste sentence of your choice</em><code>]. Could you explain that?</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>Nope, could you explain it like I'm ten years old and love pirates.</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>.........</code></p></li>
<li><p><em>….. Keep the conversation until you are pretty sure YOU know the difference between ANOVA and regression, then</em></p></li>
<li><p><code>OK, so I think that ANOVA is this</code> [<em>add your explanation</em>] <code>and regression is this</code> [<em>add your explanation</em>]. <code>Am I right? Am I missing anything?</code></p></li>
<li>
<p><code>Are there any good textbooks or websites on the topic? (note, it will only know up to 2021)</code></p>
<p><code>My career is XXXX. How are ANOVA and regression mostly used in them? Do they use special jargon around this?</code></p>
</li>
<li><p><code>Can you give me concrete examples I can google?</code></p></li>
