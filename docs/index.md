# Welcome to STAT-462!

<br>

Dr Greatrex has written this lab book to provide all the code and instructions you need for regression analysis. You will be conducting analysis using R and writing up your reports using R-Markdown.

[Unless I tell you otherwise, you can find all the code you need in this lab book]{.underline}

Don't panic if you are new to this! We will start from scratch and you are expected to have zero programming experience.
