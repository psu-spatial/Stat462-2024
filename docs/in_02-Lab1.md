## What do I submit? {#Lab_1_01}

You will be creating two files; a `.Rmd` file containing your code and a `.html` file for viewing your finished document. You need to submit BOTH of these files on the relevant Canvas assignment page. You can also add comments to your submission as needed on the canvas page, or you can message Dr G.
