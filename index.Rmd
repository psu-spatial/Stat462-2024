# Welcome to STAT-462!

<br>

This lab book has been written by Dr Helen Greatrex to help you work through the code needed to conduct applied regression analysis.  

You will be conducting analysis using R and writing up your reports using R-Markdown. Don't panic if you are new to this! We will start from scratch and you are expected to have zero programming experience.

**Unless I say otherwise, all the code you need can be found in this lab book**
