# Welcome!

**Welcome to STAT-462. This lab book has been written by Dr Helen Greatrex to help you work through the code needed to conduct applied regression analysis.**

This semester, you will be conducting analysis using R and writing up your reports using R-Markdown. Don't panic if you are new to this! We will start from scratch and you are expected to have zero programming experience.

The format of this book has been tweaked using the excellent bookdown example of [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/).
