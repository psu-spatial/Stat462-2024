# Using R Online {#Setup_Online .unnumbered}

<br>

YOU DO NOT NEED YOUR OWN COMPUTER TO BECOME AN EXPERT R-PROGRAMMER!

There are many options to access R and R-Studio online. The only downside to these is that they can be a little slower and often they cope less well with large datasets.

## Posit/R-Studio Cloud Website {#PositCloud .unnumbered}

This is an website based version of R-Studio that is owned by the same team that created it. <br><br>

#### [EVERYONE]{.underline} SHOULD SIGN UP FOR AN ACCOUNT HERE: <https://posit.cloud/>

I believe it's free for the first 25hrs each month. Sadly there is no student pricing right now. 

-   Advantages:
    -   It's always up to date
    -   You can do your labs anywhere you have access to a webpage <br>
-   Disadvantages:
    -   It's not as powerful, you won't be able to play will millions of data points
    -   You have to be online; bad internet connections make it harder
    -   It's weirdly 'buggy'. Things like you will need to install packages every lab

### What if I run out of free time?

There are a few options:

1. It's easy to transfer your labs, so you could make a new account with a new email, 

2. You pay for a single month to get through (about $5). If you are really short on cash, I will pay for it for you ON THE CONDITION that you click this link and sign up.
